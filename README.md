# RPS_Multiplayer
In this assignment, I created another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? I made this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase

## Instruction and Skills Acquired
* Create a game that suits this user story:

  * Only two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

  * Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.
